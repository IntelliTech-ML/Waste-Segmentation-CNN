# 🧠 Smart Waste Segregation and Optimization System

## 📌 Project Overview

The Smart Waste Segregation and Optimization System is a modular, intelligent framework designed to automate the classification of waste and optimize collection logistics in urban environments. This project integrates machine learning, sensor-based monitoring, and algorithmic route planning to address real-world challenges in waste management. It is built with educational clarity in mind, making it ideal for student learning, technical panels, and smart city prototypes.

The system is divided into distinct modules—each logically integrated and independently testable—ensuring scalability, maintainability, and pedagogical value.

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Automated Waste Classification using CNN.
- ✅ Real-Time Bin Monitoring via sensors.
- ✅ Route Optimization using graph algorithms.
- ✅ Flowchart-based educational logic.
- ✅ Scalable deployment from classroom to city.
